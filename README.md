## Overview

A simple PvP chess game based on inline message and edit a reply markup of a chess board. The board built with callback buttons of inline-keyboard. Bot uses the [`node-chess`](https://github.com/brozeph/node-chess) package, which is driven by the algebraic notation of moves (PGN).

#### Features:

- Inline query to start the game.
- PvP - play with friends.
- Bot works in any group or private chat.
- All moves stored in the DB, so you can play a few games simultaneously.

## Usage

To play chess simply type `@chessy_bot[SPACE]` to your telegram message input box.

Then choose a side you want to play with. You will see an inline message with a chess board and a **"Join to game"** at the bottom.

When someone join your game, this will be displayed in the status message. Also the **"Join to game"** button will become **"Settings"**.
